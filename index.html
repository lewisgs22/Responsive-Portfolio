                Hey all, I'm Lewis. I was born and raised in Ballard (North Seattle). I'm a big sports fan. Specifically I'm a big fan of the NBA because
                I grew up playing basketball, although you might not be able to tell if you met me in person becasue, well, let's just say I'm vertivally
                challenged. Due to that fact, I had to develop other interests outside of basketball. I watch a lot of movies and I especially love going
                to the theatre with my friends. I also listen to a lot of music. I'm mostly into hip-hop, but I like to think my taste is pretty ecclectic.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lately, I have also become enamored with travelling. Last summer my best friend and I went to Nicaragua to visit his brother who
                was working in the Peace Corps there at the time. Since then we have been to Iceland, the UK, France, the Netherlands, the
                Czech Republic, Hungary, and Austria.
